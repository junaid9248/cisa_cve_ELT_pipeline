# ** CISA CVE Vulnrichment ELT Data pipeline **

## _Overview_

This repository contains code for a robust data pipeline to extract, load and transform (ELT) CVE data from the CISA Vulnrichment repository. This tool extracts CVE records, processes SSVC/CVSS metrics, and loads them into a Data Lake (Google Cloud Storage) and Data Warehouse (BigQuery) for analytics.
